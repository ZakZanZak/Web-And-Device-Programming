Insulate the soil with mulch -- compost, bark, or leaves -- and make sure the containers receive adequate water during dry spells. Try planting some spring flowering bulbs in place of the annuals to enjoy some early season color.

                           color and texture, a few annuals will thrive in the shade given proper moisture and nutrients. The most shade-tolerant annuals that add color all season are coleus (grown for colorful foliage), wax begonias, and impatiens, which are available in a host of colors. Depending on the depth of shade, still other annuals, such as ageratum, sapphire flower, caladiums, and sweet alyssum, may be successful.

Dig up the plant with as much of its root system intact as possible and pot it, using quality potting soil. Cut the plant back by 40 to 50 percent, leaving some foliage on the plant. In the house, provide the plants with as much light as possible, keeping the soil slightly moist.

                           garden space of their own, but work with them to ensure success. Grow plants from large seeds, or use transplants for immediate color. Grow varieties like morning glories and gourds -- quick growing vines which produce abundant flower or fruit -- and colorful zinnias, or balsam. Encourage the child to collect seeds to save for next season. Most of all, go out and enjoy the garden together!

                           scissors. A good quality pair of shears should last many years. An advantage the scissors type has over the anvil is that it won't crush the stem while cutting. Good shears can be taken apart for sharpening, and replacement parts can be easily obtained for high quality models. Long-handled lopping shears are helpful when thinning shrubs and cutting larger stock than hand pruners can cut.

Visit your neighbors' site and try to determine the origin of the unique location -- you may have a site that is equally suitable.

Other times the differences are more drastic, such as a resistance to a disease that may be prevalent in your area; and still other times the difference may be in the ultimate height, width, or form of the plant. Read nursery catalogs and talk to garden center salespeople to determine which varieties interest you and best suit your conditions.

                           available for your plants, too much water held for long periods of time will disturb the balance of air that is necessary for healthy root growth of most plant species. Without air in the soil, many plants will likely drown. Loam, a balance of sand, clay, and organic matter, is usually well-drained. Heavily compacted clay soils are often poorly drained.
